# Tic Tac Toe

### By Mattias Sebanc

### Project Proposal

**_Application Features:_**

###### In this application, users will be able to:

- Read rules on how to play Tic Tac Toe
- Play two player Tic Tac Toe
- Play one player Tic Tac Toe against a computer
- Player one player Tic Tac Toe against an unbeatable computer

**_Users_**

###### This application will be used by:

- People looking to play Tic Tac Toe by themselves
- People looking to play Tic Tac Toe with other people

**_Interest_**

###### This application is of interest to me because:

- I like playing Tic Tac Toe with my family and think it would be fun to play Tic Tac Toe coded by me
- I heard about the minimax algorithm and want to implement it for a Tic Tac Toe game to test my knowledge of algorithms
- Coding something easily drawn on paper will help me gain a better understanding of SFML and translating ideas into code

**_Technology Used_**

- Language used is C++
- Used SFML 2.5.1 for graphical user interface 
- Incorprated the minimax recursive algorithm for a hard computer bot for users to play against
- Changed set seed to the current runtime of the program for the easy computer to maintain random moves each playthrough
- Incorporated unit tests using Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++ to ensure functionality of code
